# [Legend of the Two Kingdoms]

Author: [Eric Xu]

##[Introduction]
The project I am attempting to create comes from a chinese card game called
the Legend of the Three Kingdoms. I am attempting to make a more simplified
version of this game since the full version consists of many parts and is
very complex.

I want to do this project because I really like to play this card game. I feel
that this project will also have many challenging parts that I have not tried
to touch before. I feel that this project will be a big learning opportunity
for me and I will also enjoy this process as this is a project that I am very
interested in.

The simplified version of the game will consist of two players and each player
has 3 lives. Each player gets 4 cards that have different abilities at the
start of the game. Every round, each player gets to draw an additional 2 cards
and are able to use the cards they want to use. The goal of the game is to
eliminate the other player by getting them to have 0 lives.
